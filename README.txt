# Roberto's Development Portfolio

Welcome to my Development Portfolio! As a self-identified creative and computer-savvy individual, it was only a matter of time before I made my way into coding and web development. To concisely showcase my development capabilities and initiatives, I've centralized these full-stack projects for easy review.

## Featured Projects

### Labor Tracking App - Island Time

**Tech Stack:** Flask, Python, SQL, AWS (EC2, S3, RDS), REST API (Smartsheets), HTML, CSS

**Description:** Island Time is my primary development initiative at Island Millwork INC. This Full-Stack App allows the management team to accurately run post-mortem job analysis and exact the actual costs of labor vs. what was estimated originally.

**Tech Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

**Description:** In collaboration with three other novice programmers, we created this restaurant concept web app "Ramen Dojo." Built with the MERN stack, this project was a great immersion into version control and operating on repository branches independently of each other.
